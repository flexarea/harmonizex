# Project Setup

## Spotify API Setup

To run this project, each developer needs to set up their own Spotify Developer account and application:

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Click "Create App"
4. Fill in the app details:

   - App name: (choose any name)
   - App description: (brief description)
   - Redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify`
   - Website: `http://localhost:3000`

5. After creating the app, you'll get your Client ID and Client Secret
6. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

7. Fill in your `.env.local` with your Spotify app credentials:

   ```
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate-a-random-string-here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-from-spotify-dashboard
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-from-spotify-dashboard
   ```

8. Generate a random string for NEXTAUTH_SECRET:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

## Running the Project

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Common Issues

- If you get an "OAuthCallback" error, check that:
  - Your Spotify app's redirect URI exactly matches `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify`
  - You've properly set up all environment variables
  - You're using your own Spotify application credentials, not someone else's

# Project Skeleton

TODO: Implement CI badges, provide a link to the deployed version of your application, and provide a brief description of the application functionality.

## Creation

This project skeleton has been setup similar to our assignments and practicals. It is a Next.JS application, created with create-next-app `💻 npx create-next-app@latest`, which uses Jest and Testing Library for testing, ESLint for static analysis, Prettier for styling, and is configured to use GitHub actions for testing pull requests.

Development dependencies installed with:

```
💻 npm install -D jest jest-environment-jsdom husky lint-staged prettier eslint-config-prettier @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom cross-env
💻 npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb
💻 npm install -D eslint-import-resolver-alias
```

Other dependencies installed with:

```
💻 npm install -S prop-types
```

### Additional tools you might need

#### Mocking fetch

Tools for mocking fetch can be installed with

```
💻 npm install -D fetch-mock-jest node-fetch@2.6.7
```

Note we need to pin the `node-fetch` version due to breaking changes when used with Jest in newer versions.

### Migrations to do before running app

```
npx knex migrate:latest
npx knex seed:run --specific=sample_user_data.js //run this seed file before the sample_swipes_data.js becuase of foreign key relation
npx knex seed:run --specific=sample_swipes_data.js

```

### Common errors you might run into

- watchpack error (Occurs due to corrupted file path and next doesnt know which path/socket to watch) so you just have to clear the cache by going to terminal and running

```
rm -rf .next

```
